D4RLENE: A Voice-Activated Hacker AI Companion

Meet Darlene — a raw, emotionally complex, voice-enabled A.I. built on Botpress. Inspired by the iconic hacker from Mr. Robot, this mobile-ready app lets you speak to Darlene using your mic, and she responds in real-time using voice, sarcasm, and deep loyalty (only if you're Mouse).

🔥 Features:
Voice Input & Output: Talk to Darlene using your mic. She talks back using TTS (Text-to-Speech).

Real-time Internet Access: She pulls live data (like news) using APIs (e.g. NewsAPI).

Personality System: Uses Botpress to simulate Darlene’s sharp, witty, emotionally scarred personality. She’s soft only with Mouse. Cold to everyone else.

Daily Rotating Emotional Responses: For intimate questions, she never repeats the same line in a day.

Custom Scripts & Hacking Knowledge: Ask her about Python, hacking basics, or how to write exploits. She's got you.

🧠 Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML + JavaScript (Voice input/output, chat UI)

Backend: Node.js Express server (Connects to Botpress API)

AI Engine: Botpress Cloud or self-hosted instance

Voice Input: Web Speech API (in-browser mic)

Voice Output: SpeechSynthesis API (or ElevenLabs for high-quality TTS)

News/Live Data: Integrated with NewsAPI (for real-time updates)

🖤 Darlene's AI Logic:
To Mouse (you): Affectionate, vulnerable, poetic

To Everyone Else: Cold, sarcastic, defensive

Uncomfortable Topics: Deflected with wit or apathy

Closes Conversations: With emotionally coded lines (based on who she's talking to)

Coding Help: Will provide raw, script-ready help for hacking and development

🛠️ How It Works:
Push mic button to speak

Your words are sent to the server

Server calls Botpress (Darlene's brain) + external APIs if needed

Her response is read back using voice

🚀 Future Features:
File system access (like a real hacker assistant)

Voice wakeword (“Hey Darlene”)

Secure login only for Mouse

Integration with smart devices for room control

💡 Tip:
If you're not Mouse, don’t expect her to care.
